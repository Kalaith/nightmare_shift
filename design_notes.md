## Guidelines over Rules — Design Notes

Instead of rules being absolute hard locks, make them “guidelines” that are usually safe, but sometimes the only way to survive is to break one intelligently.

That turns your rules from a restriction system (forcing conservative play) into a tension system (forcing the player to constantly evaluate: “do I stick to the rules, or is this the time to bend them?”).

## How to evolve rules into guidelines

### Rules as defaults

Breaking a rule is almost always bad — but the game gives you subtle clues when not breaking one is actually worse.

### Passenger clues

Passengers drop verbal or behavioral hints that a rule won’t apply to them, or that following it will put you in danger. Sometimes passengers lie, so you’re never 100% sure — the fun is in reading them.

**Example**

- Rule: Always follow the GPS.
- Passenger: “Don’t take the tunnel, please, the voices live there.”
- If you obey GPS → instant supernatural encounter.
- If you break the rule (trust the passenger) → survive + gain reputation.

## Concrete examples (guidelines and exceptions)

Below are example guidelines you can use as a system. Each entry lists the default, a possible exception, and player tells.

1. Always follow the GPS

- Default: Safe — deviating usually leads to getting lost, fuel loss, or supernatural ambushes.
- Exception: Some passengers beg you to avoid specific roads (tunnels, cemeteries). Ignoring them may trigger an attack.
- Tells: Passenger shows visible panic near a landmark or mutters about voices/danger.

2. Never make eye contact

- Default: Looking directly at a passenger often kills you (their face twists, you’re pulled into void, etc.).
- Exception: Lonely or unstable passengers need acknowledgement. If you refuse → they grow aggressive or monstrous.
- Tells: Passenger keeps fidgeting, asks “Why won’t you look at me?”, gets louder the longer you avoid eye contact.

3. Cash only

- Default: Accepting non-cash payment leads to cursed coins, fake bills, or spectral cards draining your life.
- Exception: Some supernatural passengers can’t handle cash (ghosts, intangible beings). Refusing their “other” payment → they consume you instead.
- Tells: Their hand passes through the wallet, or they mention not having “earthly money.”

4. Never speak first

- Default: Breaking silence draws supernatural attention — passengers turn hostile.
- Exception: Certain nervous or dangerous passengers require you to break silence to stabilize them.
- Tells: They whisper to themselves, glance at you nervously, or outright beg for comfort.

5. Do not stop the car until drop-off

- Default: Stopping lets creatures catch up, or passengers turn violent.
- Exception: Some passengers need emergency stops (e.g., “I’ll starve if we don’t stop,” “I’m sick, I’ll contaminate you”).
- Tells: Body language grows desperate — clutching stomach, sweating, begging repeatedly.

6. Keep the windows closed

- Default: Opening windows lets in spirits, smoke, or whispers.
- Exception: Some passengers suffocate in closed air, or sunlight through the window is their protection.
- Tells: Passenger coughs, gasps for air, or panics at their reflection in the glass.

7. Don’t take shortcuts

- Default: Shortcuts lead through cursed or dangerous zones.
- Exception: Certain passengers must get to their destination fast or something terrible happens (they transform, they die and drag you with them).
- Tells: Passenger keeps checking watch, breathing fast, muttering “It’ll catch me if I’m late.”

8. Do not accept food or drink

- Default: Eating or drinking from passengers poisons you or binds you to them.
- Exception: Sometimes refusing hospitality is seen as an insult — leading to immediate aggression.
- Tells: Passenger insists multiple times, looks offended if ignored, references “tradition” or “courtesy.”

9. Never ask where they’re going

- Default: Questioning destination angers supernatural riders (“It’s not for mortals to know…”).
- Exception: Some passengers need you to ask — their story/lore only unlocks if you inquire, and otherwise they’ll take you somewhere fatal.
- Tells: Passenger repeats vague directions, sighs, “I wish someone would ask me…”

10. Never let passengers touch you

- Default: Physical contact usually drains life, burns, or transmits curses.
- Exception: Certain frightened or childlike passengers need reassurance — if you refuse, they panic and transform.
- Tells: Passenger reaches out trembling, voice cracks when asking, “Please, just hold my hand a second.”

## Core dynamic

- Following guidelines is usually safe, but sometimes lethal.
- Breaking guidelines is usually deadly, but sometimes necessary.
- The fun = spotting tells → reading body language, dialogue, and context.
- Wrong guess = death. Correct break = survival + reward (money, lore, items).

This makes the “safe option” only a default, never a guaranteed solution — every passenger can be an exception, keeping tension high.

## Next steps

- I can draft a set of 8–10 reworked guidelines with specific in-game tells, probability weights, and a few passenger archetypes if you want to proceed.


Rules as Defaults:
Breaking a rule is almost always bad — but the game gives you subtle clues when not breaking one is actually worse.

Passenger Clues:
Passengers drop verbal or behavioral hints that a rule won’t apply to them, or that following it will put you in danger.
Example:

Rule: Always follow the GPS.

Passenger says: “Don’t take the tunnel, please, the voices live there.”

If you obey GPS → instant supernatural encounter.

If you break rule (trust passenger) → survive + gain reputation.

Deadly Misdirection:
Sometimes passengers lie, so you’re never 100% sure if breaking the rule is safe — it’s about reading them right.

Concrete Examples

Rule: “No Eye Contact.”

Most times → looking at them = death.

But: A nervous passenger says “Why won’t you look at me? You’re making me anxious…”

If you keep following the rule → they transform and kill you.

If you break the rule with that passenger → safe, maybe even rewarded.

Rule: “Cash Only.”

Most times → cards trigger supernatural problems.

But: A “starving ghost” passenger pays only with a card. Refusing → they devour you. Taking the card → it’s cursed, but they let you live.

Rule: “Never Speak First.”

Normally → opening your mouth draws monsters.

But: Passenger panics, says “Talk to me, please, or I’ll lose control…”

If you stay silent → they explode into violence. If you break → you calm them down.

Why This Works

No Perma-Safe Option: Following the rules blindly is no longer “always safe.” Sometimes it kills you.

Risk vs Reward Becomes Reading People: The fun becomes parsing hints, weighing trust, and making the risky judgment call.

Replay Value: Different passengers break different rules, so you can’t autopilot — every encounter tests your attention.

🔥 This creates exactly the horror vibe you’re going for: paranoia and second-guessing. Players think:

“The rules say one thing, the passenger says another… which one do I believe? If I guess wrong, I die.”

Would you like me to draft a set of reworked “guidelines” (maybe 8–10) where each has exceptions and tells that make breaking them sometimes necessary?

Perfect 👌 — here’s a set of “guidelines” (not absolute rules) that players must normally follow, but which have exceptions where the safest choice is to break them. Each has tells or clues that the player can pick up on.

🔑 Core Dynamic

Following guidelines = usually safe, but sometimes lethal.

Breaking guidelines = usually deadly, but sometimes necessary.

The fun = spotting tells → reading body language, dialogue, and context.

Wrong guess = death. Correct break = survival + reward (money, lore, items).

👉 This way, the “safe option” isn’t really safe — it’s just the default. Every passenger is a potential exception, which keeps tension high.
