# 🚗 Nightmare Shift - React + TypeScript

A horror-themed taxi driving survival game built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Navigate the dark streets as a night shift taxi driver while following mysterious rules to survive until dawn.

## 🎮 Current Status: **FULLY MIGRATED TO TYPESCRIPT**

The application has been completely migrated from JavaScript to TypeScript with:

- ✅ **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation with strict compiler settings
- ✅ **Modern Build**: Vite 7.1 with optimized TypeScript compilation
- ✅ **Code Quality**: ESLint with TypeScript support and React hooks validation
- ✅ **Clean Architecture**: Centralized type definitions and service classes

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run linting
npm run lint
```

The game will be available at `http://localhost:5174` (or next available port)
